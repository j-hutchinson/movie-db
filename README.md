Movie DB experiment

Improvements 
- Sorting, sort by rating, release date etc. 
- Improved search, fuzzy search implementation or filtered search. Ie search by director, actor, title
- UX improvement, create page per movie and display more information such as overview etc.
- Loading / error UI states on fetching the API data. I haven't currently added these yet as I tried to stick to the 3-4 hour time frame for a take home challenge and the requests were fast enough to not show a loading state. Currently catching an logging any potential errors to the browser console for simplicity. 
- Logging and monitoring

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
